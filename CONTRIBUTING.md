## üëè Contribute

There are ways you can contribute without writing a single line of code. Here are a few things you can do to help out:

- **Replying and handling open issues**  
Some issues may lack necessary information. You can help out by guiding people through the process of filling out the issue template, asking for clarifying information, or pointing them to existing issues that match their description of the problem.
- **Reviewing pull requests for the docs**  
Reviewing Pull requests that contains documentation updates (marked with a documentation label) can be as simple as checking for spelling and grammar. If you encounter situations that can be explained better in the docs, just write a comment or edit the file right away to get started with your own contribution.
- **Providing translations**  
The translation files are located in [assets/translations](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/tree/main/assets/translations). There are 2 ways to contribute your translation and in both cases, we will take care of adding your language into the app shortly.
  1. You can either just [copy](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/blob/main/assets/translations/en.json) the content of an available translation file and send us the modified `.json` file with your language of choice via our [Telegram group](https://t.me/eNutsWallet).
  2. You can fork the repo and create a pull request with your additional translation file.

Each of these tasks is highly impactful, and maintainers will greatly appreciate your help.

If you are eager to start contributing code right away, we have a list of [good first issues](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) that contain bugs which have a relatively limited scope. We use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/pulls) to keep track of bug reports and contributions from the community. Pull request have to pass the tests and to be reviewed by a maintainer.

The process of proposing a change to eNuts can be summarized as follows:

1. Verify the open [issues](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/cashubtc/eNuts/discussions) to see if a related topic is available.
2. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
3. Make the desired changes to the sources and add tests if required.
4. Ensure the test suite passes, either locally with `npm run test` or on CI once you opened a pull request.
5. Make sure your code lints with `npm run lint`
6. Push the changes to your fork.
7. Create a pull request to the eNuts repository.
8. Request a review, link a related issue and describe your pull request.
9. If changes are requested and addressed, please request a new review to notify reviewers to take another look.

If all goes well, your pull request will be merged. If it is not merged, maintainers will do their best to explain the reason why.
